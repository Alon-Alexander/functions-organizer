# Functions Organizer

A plugin which adds the ability to move functions around the file and swith them (like you can already do with single lines).<br>
This ability helps to reformat and organize your code.

## Features

The plugin exposes a few actions, and it binds these to keyboard shortcuts:

#### Move function up (`control+shift+up`).

#### Move function down (`control+shit+up`).
